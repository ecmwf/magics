  Generates contour lines from a regular/irregular grid of data points.
  First a denser regular grid is created based on the original grid and then
  the isolines are produced by applying a simple linear contouring algorithm.
  The user may, by calling the parameter setting routines,
  select the interpolation level which defines the density of the output
  grid, which then determines the smoothness of the isolines.
