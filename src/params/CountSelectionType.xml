  The number of contour levels may be set by the user by setting
  the parameter CONTOUR_LEVEL_SELECTION_TYPE to 'COUNT' (default)
  and CONTOUR_LEVEL_COUNT to the number of levels to be plotted.
  MAGICS will then calculate the contour interval
  and the user's plot will consist of the number of levels specified
  with a regular contour interval.
  This is the default method and the default number of levels is 10.
  The exact number of contour levels plotted may not be CONTOUR_LEVEL_COUNT as
  PCONT will always use the value stored in CONTOUR_REFERENCE_LEVEL as a starting point
  and will pick reasonable values for the contour interval.
