		This output driver produces raster output in PNG, GIF, and JPEG format.
		PNG output can be produced with a transparent background which can be used for overlays.
		JPEG output is included here for backwards compatibility, but is not an ideal format for
		scientific plots in raster format.
		See also the parameters for the Base Driver.
