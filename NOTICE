           (ECMWF - http://www.ecmwf.int ).

Below is a list of software packages which are used inside Magics++:


Terralib
========

This software contains code derived from the Terralib library developed by 
National Institute for Space Research (INPE, Brazil). More information about Terralib
can be found at http://www.terralib.org . The library is distributed under 
the LGPL but special permission was granted to allow ECMWF the distribution 
of the code within Magics++.

ECMWF has a close co-operation with INPE regarding the development of 
visualisation software.

EUMETSAT Image Navigation Code
==============================

http://www.eumetsat.int/website/home/Data/DataDelivery/SupportSoftwareandTools/index.html

(c)(2014) EUMETSAT

Freeware -  freely available software, which doesn't require a signed licence
or the formal acceptance of licensing conditions.

The navigation software incorporates source code written in Fortran 90 and C-Code,
for the conversion of image coordinates (pixel column and row) into the corresponding
geographical coordinates (Latitude and Longitude) of all MSG Satellites
(Meteosat-8, Meteosat-9 and Meteosat-10) Level 1.5 VIS/IR data. The theoretical
basis for the software is the CGMS (Coordination Group for Meteorological Satellites)
LRIT/HRIT Global Specifications (PDF, 260 KB) . Additional information about how to
use the software is given as comments in the source code.

* this is done without any warranty, and EUMETSAT will not provide any
* support for its use and customisation."

Note that we (ECMWF) have made some small modifications to the code in order to allow
it to be used also for non-MSG satellite images.

libimagequant
=============

The quantization and dithering code in pngquant is lifted from Jef Poskanzer's
'ppmquant', part of his wonderful PBMPLUS tool suite.

Greg Roelofs hacked it into a (in his words) "slightly cheesy" 'pamquant' back
in 1997 (see http://pobox.com/~newt/greg_rgba.html) and finally he ripped out
the cheesy file-I/O parts and replaced them with nice PNG code in December
2000. The PNG reading and writing code is a merged and slightly simplified
version of readpng, readpng2, and writepng from his book "PNG: The Definitive
Guide."
In 2014 Greg has relicensed the code under the simplified BSD license.

Note that both licenses are basically BSD-like; that is, use the code however
you like, as long as you acknowledge its origins.
