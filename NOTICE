Copyright 2007-2012 ECMWF

This product mainly includes software developed by the 

  Meteorological Visualisation Section

at the 

  "European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts" 
           (ECMWF - http://www.ecmwf.int ).

Below is a list of software packages which are used inside Magics++:


Terralib
========

This software contains code derived from the Terralib library developed by 
National Institute for Space Research (INPE, Brazil). More information about Terralib
can be found at http://www.terralib.org . The library is distributed under 
the LGPL but special permission was granted to allow ECMWF the distribution 
of the code within Magics++.

ECMWF has a close co-operation with INPE regarding the development of 
visualisation software.

EUMETSAT Image Navigation Code
==============================

http://www.eumetsat.int/website/home/Data/DataDelivery/SupportSoftwareandTools/index.html

(c)(2014) EUMETSAT

Freeware -  freely available software, which doesn't require a signed licence
or the formal acceptance of licensing conditions.

The navigation software incorporates source code written in Fortran 90 and C-Code,
for the conversion of image coordinates (pixel column and row) into the corresponding
geographical coordinates (Latitude and Longitude) of all MSG Satellites
(Meteosat-8, Meteosat-9 and Meteosat-10) Level 1.5 VIS/IR data. The theoretical
basis for the software is the CGMS (Coordination Group for Meteorological Satellites)
LRIT/HRIT Global Specifications (PDF, 260 KB) . Additional information about how to
use the software is given as comments in the source code.

Note that we (ECMWF) have made some small modifications to the code in order to allow
it to be used also for non-MSG satellite images.

libimagequant
=============

The quantization and dithering code in pngquant is lifted from Jef Poskanzer's
'ppmquant', part of his wonderful PBMPLUS tool suite.

Greg Roelofs hacked it into a (in his words) "slightly cheesy" 'pamquant' back
in 1997 (see http://pobox.com/~newt/greg_rgba.html) and finally he ripped out
the cheesy file-I/O parts and replaced them with nice PNG code in December
2000. The PNG reading and writing code is a merged and slightly simplified
version of readpng, readpng2, and writepng from his book "PNG: The Definitive
Guide."
In 2014 Greg has relicensed the code under the simplified BSD license.

Note that both licenses are basically BSD-like; that is, use the code however
you like, as long as you acknowledge its origins.
